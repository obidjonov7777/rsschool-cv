###About Me
In 2021, I finished high school and got admission from university. Overall, I got 10 acceptance letters from different universities. 
There was one my favorite university called Inha University in Tashkent. I have dreamed about it when I was 11 years old, 
the time when this University was opened in our country. 
Currently, I am on vacation. However, I trying to master new skills and learn more about programming.
This year I finished my first year in university.
